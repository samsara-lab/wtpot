# Why

In behavioral economics, willingness to pay (WTP) is the maximum price at or below which a consumer will definitely buy your product.
At the same time, customers saying that they are ready to pay are not necessarily those who does. That's why most of market surveys will fail to give you the true statistics.

The best way to get the idea of how many customers are ready to pay you? Make real sales!

Don't have a product yet and only testing your idea? Make fake sales! + collect contacts of the paying audience for further interviews and research.
